Custom TLS Extensions in NSS
=============================

NSS is Mozilla's SSL (and more) library. Firefox and Chrome both use it.

In this repository, I am adding support for custom TLS Extensions, in support of [TACK](http://tack.io/) and similar initiatives.

The work is being done in `security/nss/lib/ssl/`.
